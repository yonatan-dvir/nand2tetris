# NAND to Tetris Project

## Introduction

The NAND to Tetris project is an educational initiative that takes you on a journey of building a computer system from the ground up. Starting with basic NAND gates, the project gradually progresses through hardware description, assembly programming, and ends with the creation of a high-level programming language.

This repository encompasses three main parts of the project:

1. **Hardware Description Language (HDL):**
   - Describes the hardware components of the computer, starting from basic gates up to a complete CPU.

2. **Assembly (ASM):**
   - Implements low-level programming using the Hack Assembly Language, allowing for programming the computer at the machine level.

3. **Virtual Machine (VM) in Java:**
   - Implements a virtual machine that runs high-level programs written in the Jack language. The virtual machine serves as an interpreter for Jack programs.
